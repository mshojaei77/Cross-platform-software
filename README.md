# Cross-Platform Software Collection

Welcome to my personal collection of cross-platform software! Here you'll find a variety of tools and applications that can be used on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Whether you're a developer looking for new tools to streamline your workflow, or just someone who wants to try out new software on different platforms, this repository has something for you. From text editors and IDEs to media players and productivity apps, there's a wide range of software to choose from.

All of the software in this repository is open source and free to use, so feel free to download and modify it as needed. And if you have any suggestions for new software to add to the collection, don't hesitate to let me know!

Happy coding!
